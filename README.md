# 🏏 CricFantasy Database – Mini Project

**Name:** [Your Name]
**Domain:** Database Management / Data Analysis
**Duration:** Academic Mini Project

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The **CricFantasy Database** is a **SQL-based mini-project** designed to manage and analyze data for a cricket fantasy league. It simulates a database for a fantasy cricket platform, covering player statistics, team compositions, match results, and user performance.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- To design and implement a **relational database schema** for a fantasy cricket application.
- To create a system for **efficient data storage, retrieval, and analysis** of cricket-related information.
- To use **SQL queries** to answer complex analytical questions for fantasy league users and administrators.

---

## 🔑 Key Activities
- **Database Design:** Developed a normalized schema with tables for Players, Teams, Matches, PlayerStats, UserTeams, and UserScores.
- **SQL Implementation:** Wrote DDL scripts for table creation and DML for data population.
- **Data Insertion:** Populated the database with sample data (players, teams, match results) from real or simulated cricket matches.
- **Querying & Analysis:** Executed complex queries to calculate fantasy points, rank users, find top-performing players, and analyze team strengths.
- **Data Integrity:** Enforced constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL) to maintain data consistency and integrity.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **SQL** – Core language for database management
- **DBMS:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite (Choose one based on your project)
- **Programming Language:** Python (for connecting and interacting with the database, if applicable)
- **Tools:** DBeaver, MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin

---

## 🏗️ Program Structure
- **DDL Scripts:** `.sql` file for creating tables and defining relationships.
- **DML Scripts:** `.sql` file for inserting sample data into the tables.
- **Query Files:** `.sql` file containing various queries for analysis (e.g., finding top players, calculating user scores).
- **Schema Diagram:** An image or PDF showing the ER Diagram (Entity-Relationship Diagram) of the database.

---

## ▶️ Execution
1. Set up the chosen DBMS (e.g., MySQL).
2. Execute the `DDL` script to create the database schema.
3. Run the `DML` script to populate the tables with data.
4. Execute the provided query files to perform analysis and retrieve results.

## 📸 Screenshot Output
*(Add your output screenshots here – e.g., a screenshot of a query result showing user rankings or a player's stats)*

---

## 🔮 Future Work
- Build a **user-friendly web interface** using a framework like Flask or Django to interact with the database.
- Implement **stored procedures and functions** for common tasks like calculating fantasy points.
- Add **triggers** to automatically update scores when new match data is entered.
- Integrate with **real-time sports APIs** to automatically fetch and update player and match statistics.
